# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description
This is a study guide for the information that was in the prework

- I wanted to create a tool that made it as easy as possible for myself and others to digest the prework information
- I was motivated to create this because I want to better understand these coding concepts before starting the course
- This solves the problem of not knowing what or how to study information
- I learned the basics of coding and creating projects while learning how to problem solve on my own
